# Dog-Breed-Classifier

Welcome to the __Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project!__
<br><br>
In this project, I built a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. 
* Given an image of a dog, this algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. 
* If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
